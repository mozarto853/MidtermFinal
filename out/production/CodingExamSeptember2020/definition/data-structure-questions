Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
To store and retrieve data in an efficient way.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
get,poll,remove,add,put

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?


what is an Array?
An Array is a group of variables that is referenced by using a single variable

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Arrays have a fixed sized while an ArrayList is resizable. Also, ArrayList can only store objects while Arrays can do both Objects and primitives.

what is LinkedList?
Creates a lot of nodes, each nodes have data and address each nodes. They are connected to each other like a link

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Linked list is better for insertion and deletion

what is queue?
FIFO. First in First out. Like a hallway.

what is stack?
FILO. First in Last out. Like an elevator.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO-queue
LIFO-stack

what is the order of complexity?
Time and input size.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Using a for loop

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
array[]
what is tree in data structure?
A non linear data structure where data is done in a hierarchical relationship

what is graph in data structure?
A non linear data structure consisting of nodes

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashTable allows duplicate keys but does not allow null keys. HashMap allows duplicate keys but only one null key.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Tree data structure

How HashMap works in java?
It stores entries in key-value pairs

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
When you try to access an element in an array that doesnâ€™t exist.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
The object.clone method and the system.arrayCopy method

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Arrays have use indexes while linkedlist uses nodes

What is DFS and BFS?
Breath first search and depth first search

What is Recursion?
A method that calls on itself repeatedly

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Linear elements are arranged sequentially while non linear elements are in a hierarchical order.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Measures the time and complexity of an algorithm

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
 a)In terms of Accessing element.
 b)In terms of Inserting element.
 c)In terms of Searching element.
 d)In terms of Removing element.
