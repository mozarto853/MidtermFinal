What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. The four features are Abstraction(implementation hiding), Encapsulation(data hiding), Inheritance(the process of acquiring properties from one class to another), and polymorphism(a single object taking many forms).

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exception in Java is usually a runtime error that causes the entire program to stop. You can handle an exception by using try-catch.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final-a keyword that prevents the modification of a variable/method.
Finally-a block that is executed whether an exception is handled or not
Finalize-a method

What is a constructor ?

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Default Constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
“This” means this class.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
Super can be used invoke a superclass properties. You can use it in a variable, constructors, and method.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
No. JVM is NOT platform independent.

What version of java are you using?
The latest version

What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
Java Runtime Environment runs bytecode while Java Development Kit is a software kit for programmers to develop Java.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JVM runs bytecode while JRE is an environment that lets java programs run

What is compile time and run time?
Compile is when we are writing code. Run time is when we are running the code.

What is heap?
A memory segment inside of the RAM

How java manage it's memory?

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
The String class in an immutable class whereas StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable.

What is Singleton class?

when to use transient variable in java?

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Garbage Collection happens by itself and it is not controlled by the user

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Stack is used to store methods and local variables. Heap is used for dynamic allocation/deallocation of memory blocks.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
It lets you look at things like classes, interfaces, and fields on runtime.

what is multithreading in java?

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Provides thread safety

What is Framework?
Bodies of code written by devs to create a product

What are the testing Framework available in java?
TestNG and JUnit

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
TestNG allows us to execute test cases while jUnit focuses more on a unit of code

What are the dependencies for this project?
mySQL and mongoDB

what is dependency injection in java?
When you make a class independent of its dependencies

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding is polymorphism while compiling. Dynamic binding is polymorphism while runtime.
